# malachite
An arbitrary-precision arithmetic library for Rust.

Parts of this library are derived from GMP, FLINT, and rugint. Very incomplete; don't use this yet.

The FLINT-derived code is based off of https://github.com/wbhart/flint2, when the last commit was
[`c9f5dd6c2fd17094ad7f88049315b31ca01736ed`](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/commit/c9f5dd6c2fd17094ad7f88049315b31ca01736ed).
This version of FLINT is referred to as "FLINT Dev 1" in comments.
