This crate defines `Rational`s. The name of this crate refers to the mathematical symbol for
rational numbers, â„š.
- There are many functions defined on `Rational`s.
  These include
  - All the ones you'd expect, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division;
  - Functions related to conversion between `Rational`s and other kinds of numbers, including
    primitive floats;
  - Functions for Diophantine approximation.
- The numerators and denominators of `Rational`s are stored as `Natural`s, so `Rational`s with
  small numerators and denominators can be stored entirely on the stack.
- Most arithmetic involving `Rational`s requires (automatically) reducing the numerator and
  denominator. This is done very efficiently by using the high performance GCD and exact
  division algorithms implemented by `Natural`s.

# Demos and benchmarks
This crate comes with a `bin` target that can be used for running demos and benchmarks.
- Almost all of the public functions in this crate have an associated demo. Running a demo
  shows you a function's behavior on a large number of inputs. For example, to demo
  `Rational` addition, you can use the following command:
  ```text
  cargo run --features bin_build --release -- -l 10000 -m exhaustive -d demo_rational_add
  ```
  This command uses the `exhaustive` mode, which generates every possible input, generally
  starting with the simplest input and progressing to more complex ones. Another mode is
  `random`. The `-l` flag specifies how many inputs should be generated.
- You can use a similar command to run benchmarks. The following command benchmarks various
  addition algorithms:
  ```text
  cargo run --features bin_build --release -- -l 1000000 -m random -b \
      benchmark_rational_add_algorithms -o gcd-bench.gp
  ```
  or GCD implementations of other libraries:
  ```text
  cargo run --features bin_build --release -- -l 1000000 -m random -b \
      benchmark_rational_add_assign_library_comparison -o gcd-bench.gp
  ```
  This creates a file called gcd-bench.gp. You can use gnuplot to create an SVG from it like
  so:
  ```text
  gnuplot -e "set terminal svg; l \"gcd-bench.gp\"" > gcd-bench.svg
  ```

The list of available demos and benchmarks is not documented anywhere; you must find them by
browsing through `bin_util/demo_and_bench`.

# Features
- `32_bit_limbs`: Sets the type of `Limb` to `u32` instead of the default, `u64`.
- `test_build`: A large proportion of the code in this crate is only used for testing. For a
  typical user, building this code would result in an unnecessarily long compilation time and
  an unnecessarily large binary. My solution is to only build this code when the `test_build`
  feature is enabled. If you want to run unit tests, you must enable `test_build`. However,
  doctests don't require it, since they only test the public interface.
- `bin_build`: This feature is used to build the code for demos and benchmarks, which also
  takes a long time to build. Enabling this feature also enables `test_build`.
