Welcome to the Malachite blog!

After 5 years and over 600,000 lines of code, I'm finally releasing Malachite, a high-performance
arbitrary-precison arithmetic library for Rust. There's a lot of stuff in this library, and while
it's well-documented on docs.rs, I think it's a good idea to publish some long-form explanations of
what it can do and what the ideas behind it are.
