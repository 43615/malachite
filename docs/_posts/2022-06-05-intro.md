Welcome to the Malachite blog!

After 5 years and over 600,000 lines of code, I'm finally releasing Malachite, a high-performance
arbitrary-precison arithmetic library for Rust. There's a lot of stuff in this library, and while
it's well-documented on docs.rs, I think it's a good idea to publish some long-form explanations of
what it can do and what the ideas behind it are.

In my next post, I'm going to start off by talking a bit about _exhaustive iterators_ that generate
every value of some type (possibly under some constraints). This may seem unrelated to bignum
arithmetic, but I'm convinced that these iterators, along with iterators that generate random
values, are the best tool for testing a mathematical library, short of full-blown formal
verification.
